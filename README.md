# ![MadMilkman.Docx component's icon](../master/MadMilkman.Docx/Properties/MadMilkman.Docx.png) MadMilkman.Docx
**MadMilkman.Docx** is a .NET component which can enable you to create a new DOCX file by appending a HTML and RTF content to the DOCX document's body, header and footer.

The component targets .NET Framework version 4.5, but note that currently it does not use any assembly above version 3.0.

## TODO list:
* Write README.md summery
* Create MadMilkman.Docx wiki with the following sections:
  * Overview
  * API References
  * Limitations
  * About AltChunks
* Create the following sample projects:
  * WPF application with some rich text RTF editor control.
    The sample will demonstrate how to export RTF content to DOCX file.
  * ASP.NET MVC application with some wysiwyg HTML editor control.
    The sample will demonstrate how to export HTML content to DOCX file.
* Create MadMilkman.Docx NuGet package

## Feedback:
I won't be able to start working on the above TODO list until the middle of August, but nevertheless please feel free to contact me with any questions, suggestions or issues regarding the MadMilkman.Docx component.
